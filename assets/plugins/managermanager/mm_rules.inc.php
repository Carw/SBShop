// MM rules can go in here, instead of a chunk.
// If you want to put your rules in a chunk, create one and specify its name in the plugin's configuration tab
// If you copy them to a chunk, don't include the opening and closing PHP tags

// ------------------------ INSERT YOUR RULES HERE --------------------
// Insert your rules here. You can also use a chunk; see the plugin configuration and documentation.
// For example rules, also see the default.mm_rules.inc.php and the documentation. PHP is allowed.
